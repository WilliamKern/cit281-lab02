# CIT 281 Lab 02

## Overview  
Lab 02 introduced the fundamentals of Git version control and expanded on modern JavaScript essentials. The lab focused on understanding how files are tracked, staged, committed, and ignored within a Git repository. You practiced using both command-line Git commands and Visual Studio Code’s Git integration, while also refreshing key JavaScript concepts like array methods, objects, scope, and callbacks.

## Objectives  
- Understand Git’s core workflow and file tracking system:
  - Initialize a Git repository
  - Add and commit files
  - Use `.gitignore` to manage intentionally untracked files
  - Understand file states: untracked, tracked, staged, committed
  - Use `git status` and `git diff` to inspect repo changes  
- Apply Git wildcards to batch-add files (`*.js`, `git add .`, etc.)  
- Learn how cloud repositories work and how to clone one using HTTPS  
- Refresh and apply essential JavaScript topics:
  - `let`, `const`, and variable scope
  - Array methods: `map()`, `forEach()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, `indexOf()`
  - JSON parsing/stringifying
  - Callback functions and function expressions
  - Working with arrays and objects

## Deliverables  
- JavaScript files demonstrating use of callback functions and array/object manipulation  
- `.gitignore` file configured to exclude unnecessary files/folders from version control  
- Screenshot(s) or notes demonstrating Git command usage and VSCode Git integration  
- Example Git logs or commit history output (as `.txt`)  

## What I Learned  
This lab gave me a much deeper understanding of how Git tracks changes and how to properly manage file states in a version-controlled project. I practiced working with real JavaScript logic using functions, arrays, and objects while maintaining clean and intentional repo history. I now feel more confident using `.gitignore`, interpreting Git status messages, and pushing projects to GitHub cleanly and consistently.
